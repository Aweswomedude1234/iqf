Style & Theme
Create a sleek, modern, vibrant website with a clean white background, standout black text and black buttons, and light orange accents throughout (highlights, and the top bar).


Use a professional Google Font like Poppins (or a similar clean, modern sans-serif).


Incorporate smooth animations and interactive effects — text that types out when first loaded, sections that fade or slide in from the side as you scroll, and hover effects on buttons and images. Animations should feel polished and professional, not flashy.


Header / Navigation
Top bar (light orange) with the logo text “IQ Foundation” aligned left.


A navigation menu aligned right with links to: Home, About Us, Our Cause, Our Team, Missions, Events, Join Us, Volunteer, Sponsor, Partner.


Include a search bar at the top right corner.


Hero Section (top of homepage)
Large headline text in black:
 "Where curiosity meets innovation."


Directly beneath it, in gray smaller text:
 "Unlocking knowledge and creativity for learners everywhere."


Add typewriter animation to the headline (so the black text types out when the page loads).


Homepage Layout
As you scroll:


Upcoming Events preview – Show event cards with date, time, location, age group, description, and buttons for Sign Up and Volunteer.


Photo highlights – A section with rotating images or a grid of past events.


About Us (short) – A small description with a “Learn More” button that links to the About page.


Join Us section – Brief text with a Join Us button.


Include animations such as fade-in, slide-in, and text typing effects as sections scroll into view.
